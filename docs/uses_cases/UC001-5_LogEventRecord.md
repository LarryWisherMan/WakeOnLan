# Use Case: Log Event Record

## **Use Case ID**: UC001-5

---

## **Short Description**
The system creates and updates an event record to track the status and results of the Wake-on-LAN process. This ensures a complete log of actions, outcomes, and errors for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.

---

## **Primary Actor**
- **WoL Service**: Responsible for initiating the creation of event records and updating them as the process progresses.

---

## **Secondary Actors**
- **Monitor Service**: Updates the event record with the target computer's status during monitoring.
- **Admin**: Reviews the event record for status and troubleshooting information.

---

## **Preconditions**
- The WoL Service has initiated a wake-up request for the target computer.
- Logging functionality is operational and accessible.

---

## **Postconditions**
- **On Success**:
  - A new event record is created for the wake-up process.
  - The record is updated with all relevant statuses and outcomes (e.g., magic packet sent, monitoring results, success/failure).
- **On Failure**:
  - Any errors encountered during the logging process are recorded in the system logs.
  - The admin is notified if logging fails.

---

## **Main Flow**
1. The WoL Service initiates the creation of a new event record.
2. The event record is populated with initial details, including:
   - Target computer name/IP.
   - MAC address.
   - Timestamp of the wake-up request.
   - Proxy computer name/IP.
3. After the magic packet is sent, the record is updated with the transmission status.
4. During monitoring, the Monitor Service periodically updates the record with the target computerâ€™s status (e.g., online, retries remaining).
5. When the target computer is successfully woken up or the process fails:
   - The event record is finalized with the outcome (success/failure) and a timestamp.
6. The system ensures the event record is stored securely and is accessible for future review.

---

## **Alternate Flows**

### **Failure to Create Event Record**
- If the system cannot create an event record due to an error:
  - The system logs the error.
  - The admin is notified of the logging issue.
  - The wake-up process continues without an event record.

---

## **Extensions**
- **Audit Trail**:
  - The system includes additional fields in the event record for audit purposes, such as:
    - User who initiated the request.
    - Duration of the wake-up process.
    - Number of retries attempted.
- **Integration with External Systems**:
  - The event record can be exported or synchronized with external monitoring systems or logging frameworks.

---

## **Special Requirements**
1. **Persistence**:
   - Event records must be stored in a persistent database or logging system for long-term access.
2. **Performance**:
   - Logging operations must complete within 100 milliseconds to avoid impacting the overall process.
3. **Security**:
   - Event records must be protected against unauthorized access and tampering.
4. **Searchability**:
   - Event records must be searchable by fields such as target computer name, timestamp, and outcome.

---

## **Trigger**
- The use case starts when the WoL Service begins the wake-up process by sending a magic packet to the Proxy Computer.
