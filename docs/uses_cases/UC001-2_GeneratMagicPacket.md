# Use Case: Generate Magic Packet

## **Use Case ID**: UC001-2

---

## **Short Description**
The system generates a Wake-on-LAN (WoL) magic packet using the target computer’s MAC address. The magic packet is a specific data structure that triggers the target computer to wake up when received on its network interface.

---

## **Primary Actor**
- **WoL Service**: Responsible for generating the magic packet.

---

## **Secondary Actors**
- **Proxy Computer**: May be involved in relaying the packet but does not directly interact with this sub-use case.

---

## **Preconditions**
- The MAC address of the target computer has been validated by the system.
- WoL Service is operational and ready to process requests.

---

## **Postconditions**
- **On Success**:
  - A valid magic packet is generated.
  - The packet is prepared for transmission to the Proxy Computer.
- **On Failure**:
  - The system logs the failure to generate the packet.
  - The admin is notified, and the use case terminates.

---

## **Main Flow**
1. The WoL Service receives the validated MAC address of the target computer.
2. The WoL Service constructs the magic packet:
   - The packet is 102 bytes in size, starting with six bytes of `FF` (255 in hexadecimal).
   - This is followed by 16 repetitions of the target computer’s MAC address.
3. The system validates the structure of the generated magic packet:
   - Ensures the packet adheres to the Wake-on-LAN protocol standards.
4. The magic packet is stored in memory or queued for transmission to the Proxy Computer.

---

## **Alternate Flows**

### **Invalid MAC Address**
- If the provided MAC address fails internal re-validation during packet generation:
  - The system logs the error (e.g., "Invalid MAC address during packet generation").
  - The admin is notified of the issue.
  - The use case terminates.

---

## **Extensions**
- **Custom Packet Options**:
  - The system allows additional optional data (e.g., security tokens) to be appended to the magic packet if configured by an admin.
- **Encryption Support**:
  - For environments requiring secure transmission, the system supports generating encrypted magic packets.

---

## **Special Requirements**
1. **Performance**:
   - The magic packet must be generated within 500 milliseconds.
2. **Compliance**:
   - The packet structure must comply with the IEEE Wake-on-LAN standards.
3. **Scalability**:
   - The system should handle simultaneous packet generation for multiple targets without significant performance degradation.

---

## **Trigger**
- The use case starts when the WoL Service completes validation of the target computer’s MAC address as part of the "Wake Offline Computer on Any Subnet" main use case.
